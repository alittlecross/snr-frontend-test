# Frontend Test

# Markup test
Prepare your thoughts to discuss how you would mark-up the design (front-end markup-test.pdf) during the interview.

# Javascript Test: Address lookup
Please complete the following node based exercise. It should take around 1 hour to complete. Please push the code to a public repository and send us a link to it 24hours before your interview for us to review and discuss.

## Get started

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Exercise
Write routes to render `index.njk` and `addresses.njk` in the routes folder.

Write a post request to the address API using details in `config.js`.

Display request results in the `addresses.njk` select element.

Write suitable unit tests for functionality (start with the API call and expand if time allows).

If time allows add some markup validation, e.g. what if the input is invalid?
